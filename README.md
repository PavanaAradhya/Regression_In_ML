# Regression_In_ML
📈 Types of Regression in Machine Learning
This project demonstrates different types of regression techniques using Python and scikit-learn.
Each regression model is trained on a synthetic dataset and visualized for better understanding.

🚀 Regressions Covered
Linear Regression

Polynomial Regression

Ridge Regression

Lasso Regression

ElasticNet Regression

Support Vector Regression (SVR)

Decision Tree Regression

Random Forest Regression

📋 Project Structure
Generate Data: Synthetic dataset generated using a sine function plus some noise.

Train Models: Various regression algorithms are trained on the dataset.

Visualize: Each model's predictions are plotted against the true data points.

📚 Learning Outcomes
Understand various regression techniques.

Visual comparison between different regressors.

Basics of overfitting and underfitting using polynomial degrees.

Usage of regularization techniques like Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet.

🤔 When to Use Which Regression?

Regression Type	Best For
Linear Regression	Simple linear relationships
Polynomial Regression	Non-linear relationships
Ridge Regression	When multicollinearity exists
Lasso Regression	Feature selection and sparsity
ElasticNet Regression	Both Ridge and Lasso effects
Support Vector Regression	Complex non-linear boundaries
Decision Tree Regression	Non-parametric regression
Random Forest Regression	Ensemble-based accuracy
